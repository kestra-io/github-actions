# Deploy Action

Official GitHub Action to create a CI/CD pipeline that deploys [Flows](https://kestra.io/docs/workflow-components/flow) or [Namespace Files](https://kestra.io/docs/concepts/namespace-files) to your Kestra server.

This action should be used within a workflow that runs only on your `main` branch.
